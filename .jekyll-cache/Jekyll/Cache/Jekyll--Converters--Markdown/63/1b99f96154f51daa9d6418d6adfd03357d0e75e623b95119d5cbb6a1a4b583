<p><strong>Rant</strong></p>

<p>Productivity tweak for non productivity fanatics. Yeah sure you can use vim, emacs or spacemacs(freaky splice of vim and emacs), but if you like me live in the 21st and want to embrace it, and are happy to use well engineered mouse or touchpad occasionally when it just makes sense. Contra remembering a weird combination of keystrokes, which for certain will only mess up, and have to browse some manual to fix. Like learning dvorak instead qwerty, just a useless impractical skill. Not trying express my experiences and opinions, just being objective ;) Instead i like to use my intuition, which i have developed over many years, will do many years to come. The interfaces i was introduced to made my intuition as is, and changing an intuition from the bottom up is hard and does not make a lot of sense to me, instead i want to build on top of it. I found that the concept ‚Äúeasymotion‚Äù works greats with my already established workflow.</p>

<p><strong>What is it</strong></p>

<p><strong>How to use</strong></p>

<p><strong>How does it work</strong>
For the interested</p>
