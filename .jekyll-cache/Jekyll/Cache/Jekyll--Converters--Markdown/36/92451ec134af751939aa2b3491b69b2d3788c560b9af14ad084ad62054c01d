I"q<p>After some personal requests for the <a href="https://github.com/cnHeider/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> of my setups, I have published them on github.</p>

<p>I am running Debian Strech, with non-free repos. My setup is minimal, I am running Openbox, Tint2, Feh and Synapse semantic launcher which in my opinion is more than enough to give you fully functional desktop environment and further more is fully customisable.</p>

<p>I am running my own <a href="https://github.com/cnHeider/synapse">fork</a> of Synapse, which i re-themed and made some plug-ins for.</p>

<p>My conky configs is also included, but it is hardcoded for my 1366x756 resolution, but should be easily modifiable for any resolution.</p>
